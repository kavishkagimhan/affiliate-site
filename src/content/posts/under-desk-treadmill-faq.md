## Buying & Selection

<h3 id="is-worth-it">Is an under desk treadmill worth it?</h3>

**Yes, for most people.** If you sit 6+ hours daily and work from home, an under desk treadmill offers excellent ROI. Benefits include:

- Burns 100-200 extra calories per hour
- Reduces sitting-related health risks
- Improves focus and energy
- No extra time required (exercise during work)
- ROI of 1,600-1,800% over 5 years

Not worth it if you already exercise 1-2 hours daily or can't have a standing desk. [Read our complete ROI analysis](/posts/is-under-desk-treadmill-worth-it).

---

<h3 id="best-canada">What's the best under desk treadmill in Canada?</h3>

**Our top pick:** **WalkingPad C2 Pro** ($649 CAD) - Best overall balance of features, quality, and price.

**Budget pick:** **UMAY Portable** ($449 CAD) - Excellent value with brushless motor.

**Premium pick:** **Lifespan TR1200-DT3** ($799 CAD) - Commercial-grade quality with 3-year warranty.

The "best" depends on your needs (budget, space, noise tolerance, usage hours). [See our complete comparison of top models](/posts/best-under-desk-treadmill-canada).

---

<h3 id="how-much">How much should I spend on an under desk treadmill?</h3>

**Budget: $400-$500** - Good for light use (2-3 hours/day), basic features  
**Mid-range: $500-$700** - Better motors, quieter, suitable for daily use (4-6 hours)  
**Premium: $700-$900+** - Commercial-grade, highest durability, all-day use

**Recommendation:** Don't go below $400 CAD - quality suffers significantly. The $500-700 range offers the best value for most buyers.

[See our best under $500 guide](/posts/under-desk-treadmill-under-500) for budget options.

---

<h3 id="vs-walking-pad">Under desk treadmill vs walking pad - what's the difference?</h3>

**Short answer:** They're the same thing. "Walking pad" often refers to the WalkingPad brand, while "under desk treadmill" is the generic term.

**Technical differences:**
- "Walking pads" typically emphasize ultra-compact, foldable design
- Both are low-profile treadmills for walking while working
- Functionality is identical

Don't get hung up on terminology - focus on features, quality, and reviews. [Read our detailed comparison](/posts/under-desk-treadmill-vs-walking-pad).

---

<h3 id="what-size">What size under desk treadmill do I need?</h3>

**Deck length:**
- Under 5'8": 40-42" deck works fine
- 5'8"-6'2": 42-45" deck recommended
- Over 6'2": 48"+ deck needed

**Deck width:**
- Minimum: 16"
- Comfortable: 18-20"
- Ideal: 20"+

**Folded size:** Most fold to 5-7" thick - measure your storage space before buying.

Taller users should check our [under desk treadmill for tall people guide](#) for specific recommendations.

---

## Usage & Performance

<h3 id="work-while-walking">Can you really work while walking on a treadmill?</h3>

**Yes!** But there's a learning curve (2-4 weeks).

**What works well:**
- Reading/research
- Emails
- Video calls (at slow speeds)
- Writing/typing (after adaptation)
- Data analysis

**What's difficult:**
- Precision design work
- Rapid data entry
- Gaming
- Fine motor tasks

**Tips for success:**
- Start at 1.5-2 km/h
- Gradually increase speed
- Practice typing while walking
- Use keyboard shortcuts

Most users report 60-80% of their work is perfectly walkable once adapted. [Learn how to use effectively](#).

---

<h3 id="what-speed">What speed should I walk at while working?</h3>

**Ideal working speed: 2-3 km/h (1.2-1.9 mph)**

This allows you to:
- Type comfortably
- Maintain focus
- Talk during calls
- Walk for hours without fatigue

**Speed breakdown:**
- 1-1.5 km/h: Very slow, good for starting
- 2-3 km/h: Perfect for working (RECOMMENDED)
- 3-4 km/h: Light exercise, harder to focus
- 4-6 km/h: Pure exercise, can't work effectively

Start slow and increase gradually over 2-3 weeks.

---

<h3 id="how-many-hours">How many hours per day can I use an under desk treadmill?</h3>

**Depends on the model:**

**Budget models ($400-500):** 2-4 hours/day safe  
**Mid-range ($500-700):** 4-6 hours/day comfortable  
**Premium ($700+):** 6-8+ hours/day designed capacity

**Your body limits:**
- Start with 30-60 minutes daily
- Gradually increase to 2-3 hours
- Most users settle at 3-4 hours daily
- Take breaks every hour

Listen to your body - if feet or legs hurt, reduce duration. Build up slowly over weeks.

---

<h3 id="can-run">Can I run on an under desk treadmill?</h3>

**No, you shouldn't.** Under desk treadmills are designed for walking only (up to 6-8 km/h max).

**Why not running:**
- No handrails for balance
- Motors not designed for running impact
- Safety risk without rails
- Voids warranty on most models

**For running:** Get a regular treadmill with handrails and 10-20 km/h capacity.

Some 2-in-1 models with removable handrails support light jogging up to 8-10 km/h - check specs carefully.

---

<h3 id="weight-loss">Do under desk treadmills actually help you lose weight?</h3>

**Yes - if used consistently.**

**Math:**
- Walking 3 hours/day at 3 km/h
- Burns ~350-400 extra calories/day
- That's ~2,500 calories/week
- Equals ~1.5 lbs fat loss/month
- **Potential: 15-20 lbs/year without diet changes**

**Real results:**
Users report 5-15 lbs weight loss in first 6 months with no other changes.

**Key factors:**
- Consistency matters most
- Walk 3+ hours daily for best results
- Combine with healthy diet for faster results
- Don't compensate by eating more

## Noise & Apartments

<h3 id="are-quiet">Are under desk treadmills quiet?</h3>

**Depends on the motor type:**

**Brushless motors: 42-50 dB** (whisper-quiet)  
**Brushed motors: 52-60 dB** (moderate, noticeable)

**For reference:**
- 40 dB = Quiet library
- 50 dB = Quiet conversation
- 60 dB = Normal conversation

**Quietest models:**
1. WalkingPad C2 Pro (42 dB)
2. Lifespan TR1200-DT3 (45 dB)
3. WalkingPad A1 Pro (46 dB)

Under 50dB is quiet enough for video calls. [See our quiet models guide](/posts/quiet-under-desk-treadmill-apartments).

---

<h3 id="neighbors-hear">Will my neighbors hear my under desk treadmill?</h3>

**Probably not, if you:**
- Choose a model <50dB
- Use a quality exercise mat (essential)
- Avoid using during quiet hours (before 8 AM, after 9 PM)
- Walk gently (no stomping)

**Downstairs neighbors:** With a good mat and quiet model, most neighbors won't hear anything. The mat absorbs 40-60% of vibration.

**Side neighbors:** Very unlikely to hear through walls.

**Best practices:**
- Invest in 8-10mm rubber exercise mat ($40-80)
- Choose brushless motor models
- Inform neighbors proactively (good relations)
- Test at different times and ask for feedback

[Complete apartment guide here](/posts/quiet-under-desk-treadmill-apartments).

---

<h3 id="quietest-model">What's the quietest under desk treadmill?</h3>

**#1 Quietest: WalkingPad C2 Pro** - 42 dB  
Price: $649 CAD  
Features: Brushless motor, app control, auto-speed

**#2: Lifespan TR1200-DT3** - 45 dB  
Price: $799 CAD  
Features: Commercial-grade, extra-long deck

**#3: WalkingPad A1 Pro** - 46 dB  
Price: $499 CAD  
Features: Budget-friendly, still very quiet

All three are quiet enough for apartments and video calls. The difference between 42dB and 46dB is barely noticeable.

---

<h3 id="apartment-use">Can I use an under desk treadmill in an apartment?</h3>

**Absolutely!** With proper setup:

**Requirements:**
1. Quiet model (<50dB)
2. Quality exercise mat (essential)
3. Respectful hours (9 AM - 9 PM)
4. Gentle walking style

**Success rate:** 90%+ of apartment users report no complaints when following best practices.

**Red flags:**
- Older buildings with hollow floors
- Strict noise policies in lease
- Known sound-sensitive neighbors below

**Pro tip:** Set up your treadmill, use it, then go downstairs and listen. If you can barely hear it from below with a mat, you're good.

## Technical Specs

<h3 id="weight-capacity">What weight capacity do I need?</h3>

**Rule:** Your weight + 10-15 kg (20-30 lbs) safety margin.

**Standard capacities:**
- 100 kg (220 lbs): Most budget models
- 110 kg (242 lbs): Mid-range models
- 120 kg (265 lbs): Better mid-range
- 150+ kg (330+ lbs): Premium/commercial models

**Example:** If you weigh 95 kg (210 lbs), get minimum 110 kg capacity, ideally 120 kg.

**Why safety margin matters:**
- Extends motor life
- Ensures belt durability
- Safer operation
- Better warranty coverage

Heavier users should see our [heavy-duty models guide](#) for 300+ lb capacity options.

---

<h3 id="space-required">How much space does an under desk treadmill take?</h3>

**When in use:**
- Length: 120-130 cm (4-4.5 feet)
- Width: 50-65 cm (1.5-2 feet)
- Height: 12-15 cm (5-6 inches)
- Clear space needed: 150 x 80 cm minimum

**When folded:**
- Thickness: 13-18 cm (5-7 inches)
- Fits under most beds
- Stands in closets
- Slides behind furniture

**Measure before buying:**
1. Under-desk clearance (need 13+ cm)
2. Storage location
3. Walking area (need 60+ cm width for comfort)

Most models are 125cm x 55cm when flat - fits under standard standing desks.

---

<h3 id="need-standing-desk">Do I need a standing desk for an under desk treadmill?</h3>

**Yes, or a desk that can go high enough.**

**Options:**
1. **Adjustable standing desk** ($300-600) - Best option
2. **Desktop riser** ($80-150) - Budget-friendly
3. **DIY solution** ($50-100) - Adjustable legs/blocks

**Height needed:**
- Treadmill deck: ~12-15 cm high
- Your desk needs to be 100-120 cm high total
- Standard sitting desks are 70-75 cm (too low)

**Can't get a standing desk?**
Consider a 2-in-1 treadmill with handrails - can be used without a desk for pure exercise.

---

<h3 id="warranty">What's the typical warranty on under desk treadmills?</h3>

**Budget models:** 1 year limited  
**Mid-range:** 1-2 years parts & labor  
**Premium:** 2-3 years full, some offer 5-year motor warranties

**What's usually covered:**
- Motor defects
- Frame issues
- Belt problems
- Electronics failure

**Usually NOT covered:**
- Normal wear and tear
- Misuse or overloading
- Cosmetic damage
- Shipping costs

**Canadian considerations:**
- Verify warranty is valid in Canada
- Check who handles repairs (local vs. ship back)
- Register warranty immediately after purchase

Lifespan offers 3-year warranties - among the best in the industry.
