Living in a small Canadian apartment or condo doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your fitness goals. With the right under desk treadmill and smart setup strategies, you can create a healthy, productive workspace in even the tiniest living spaces.

This comprehensive guide covers everything from choosing the most compact models to creative storage solutions that actually work in real small spaces.

## Understanding Small Space Challenges

### What Counts as "Small Space"?

**Studio/Bachelor:** 300-500 sq ft  
**1-Bedroom:** 500-700 sq ft

**Common challenges:**

```

**Daily routine:**
