## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is $400-500 enough for a good under desk treadmill?

**Yes!** While you won't get premium features, several quality models in the $400-500 range offer reliable performance, decent build quality, and essential features. The UMAY ($449) and Treadly 2 Pro ($499) are excellent examples.

### Should I buy used to save money?

**Maybe.** Used treadmills can save 30-50%, but risks include:
- No warranty
- Unknown usage history
- Hidden wear
- No return policy

**If buying used:** Test thoroughly, check motor hours if available, inspect belt condition, verify all functions work.

### How long will a budget treadmill last?

**Typical Lifespan:**
- Light use (1-2 hours/day): 5-7 years
- Moderate use (3-4 hours/day): 3-5 years
- Heavy use (5+ hours/day): 2-4 years

**With proper maintenance, you can extend these ranges by 20-40%.**

### Will a $450 treadmill be too loud?

Not necessarily! The UMAY at $449 features a brushless motor rated at 48dB—quiet enough for most situations including video calls. Motor type matters more than price.

### Can I trust budget warranties?

**Generally yes, if:**
- Buying from reputable retailer (Amazon, Walmart)
- Known brand with contact info
- Clear warranty terms
- Verifiable company

**Register your warranty immediately upon purchase.**

### Should I wait for sales or buy now?

**Wait if:**
- Major sale event within 4-6 weeks
- Not urgent need
- Flexible on model choice

**Buy now if:**
- Need immediately
- Good deal currently available
- Specific model may sell out

**Budget Tip:** Price track for 2-3 weeks to understand typical pricing.

## When to Upgrade from Budget

Consider upgrading to premium models ($650+) if:

### ✅ You're Using 5+ Hours Daily

Budget models aren't built for extreme use. If you're walking all day, invest in commercial-grade.

### ✅ You Exceed Weight Capacity

Safety and longevity require adequate capacity. Premium models offer 130-160 kg capacities.

### ✅ Noise is Critical

If you're on calls 6+ hours daily, the whisper-quiet premium models (42-45dB) justify the cost.

### ✅ You Need Durability

Planning to use for 10+ years? Premium models with 3-year warranties and commercial construction are worth it.

### ✅ You Want Advanced Features

Love tracking stats, need app integration, or want auto-speed? Premium features enhance experience.
